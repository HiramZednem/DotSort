# DotSort

DotSort was born from a personal need: I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to take notes, but as my number of notes grew, managing them became a mess.

As a Mexican developer, I use the date format `dd-mm-yyyy` to name my files. Over time, this made it harder to keep my notes sorted correctly—especially in systems that don't naturally sort dates in this format. Here's a visual example of the issue:

To solve this, I created **DotSort** — a simple tool to help me (and now, maybe you too) organize date-based files more effectively.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Rename files** from `dd-mm-yyyy` format to `yyyy-mm-dd` (ISO-friendly).
- 🗂️ **Automatically create folders** like `01-january-2025` and move files into the correct folder based on the date.
- 🧠 **(Coming soon)**: A smart sorter that organizes files based on their **file type/extension**.

---

## 🔭 Roadmap

In the near future, I plan to:

- Build a **visual interface with Electron** to make DotSort accessible to non-technical users.
- Allow customizable folder rules and patterns for organizing different types of directories.
- Support for other date formats and localization.

## 🚀 Why the name?

“DotSort” is inspired by dotfiles in Linux (hidden files starting with `.`), and the idea of bringing order to file chaos—starting with something as small as a dot.
